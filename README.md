# Online Banking System (course project)

## About The Project
**This is a rudimentary version of an online banking system created as the final project for my course 'Introduction to Python Programming', 
which is offered online by the University of Pennsylvania, however slightly modified to be larger in scope and more general-purpose than 
originally conceived by the course.**

<br>

I have included two versions of the project, the first is a Python script with the raw code, the second is a Jupyter Notebook version, which
breaks down the program into separate cells, making the program easier to read and interact with. I have also included 2 files, both of which 
are used by the program to create its initial database for the online banking system. The files are automatically updated as (fictional) bank 
users make changes to their accounts. 
<br>
<br>

### Description
#### This program consists of several key user-defined functions to carry out different operations pertaining to every online banking system. Such functions include:
 - **Importing information about bank clients and creating a profile for each client.** <br>
 - **Importing information about clients and creating an online user account for each.** <br>
 - **Signing up to the online banking system for new users.** <br> 
 - **Logging in to the system.** <br> 
 - **Updating account balance.** <br> 
 - **Transfering money to another account.** <br> 
 - **Changing the account's password.** <br> 
 - **Deleting the account.** <br> 

**Finally, there is the program's main function which allows the user to select the option they like from the above list.**
<br>
<br>

## Aim 
**The aim of this project is to demonstrate the capacity to work with Python's data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.), create user-defined 
functions to acheive specific ends, deal with simple files, and, generally, to demonstrate the capacity to understand and use the language.** <br>
**Note, therefore, that this project should not be regarded as a simulation of an actual online banking system, but only a project to demonstrate 
the learner's ability to use the language.**

## Executing the Program 
**You can quickly access and execute the program by clicking on the link below. The link will immediately direct you to the 
Jupyter notebook version of the project, which will enable you to interact with the code and run the program's main function 
to perform any number of operations from the ones listed above. Note, however, before executing the program's main function,
you must first run all the cells up to it, so that all the necessary sub-functions are created and ready for use. Feel free 
to interact with and test the program in whatever way you like.**
